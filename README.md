# Block Manager

THe BlockManager package is tool for managing components in a block-based fashion. This allows page layouts to be managed from an external source (such as a content management system or database), and then rendered in a consistent way.

It has been designed with Hygraph in mind, but can be used in any project.

Example block components are provided in the `__TESTS__` folder.
